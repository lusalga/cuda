Our kernel implementation utilizes 21 registers. According to our deviceQuery, we have 65536 registers for each block, which gives us a theoretical number of 3120 threads. However, since we are limited to 1024 threads per block we use this limit instead (we will be working underneath the memory limit present in the GPU). Then given that we have 8 multiprocessors with 2 blocks each (limit of 2048 threads per multiprocessor), we achieve a total number of 8 * 2 * 1024 = 16384 threads scheduled concurrently.
